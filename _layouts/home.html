            <h3>Yes, there's a book!</h3>
              <p>Written by the creator of Trailblazer, this book gives you <b>300 pages full of wisdom about Trailblazer</b> and its gems, such as Reform, Cells and Roar.</p>

              <p>The book comes with a <a href="https://github.com/apotonick/gemgem-trbrb">sample app repository</a> to conveniently browse through changes per chapter.</p>

              <p>In the book, <b>we build a realistic Rails application with Trailblazer</b> that discusses convoluted requirements such as dynamic forms, polymorphic rendering and processing for signed-in users, file uploads, pagination, a JSON document API sitting on top of that, and many more problems you run into when building web applications.</p>

              <p>Check out the <a href="/books/trailblazer.html">full book description</a> for a few more details about the content.</p>
